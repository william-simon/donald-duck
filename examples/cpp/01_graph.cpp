/**
 * @file 01_graph.cpp
 *
 * @brief Example demonstrating basic usage of the Generic Graph Library (GHL).
 *
 * This example showcases:
 * - Creating and manipulating a simple city/road graph structure
 * - Working with custom vertex (City) and edge (Road) properties
 * - Basic graph traversal and property access
 * - Graph visualization using GraphViz output
 *
 * The example creates a small graph representing cities connected by roads,
 * demonstrates how to access and print vertex/edge properties, and shows
 * how to output the graph structure for visualization.
