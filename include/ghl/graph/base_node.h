 * @brief Defines the base class for vertex properties in the Generic Graph
 * Library.
 *
 * This file contains the BaseNode class which serves as the foundation for all
 * vertex property classes in the GHL. It provides basic functionality such as
 * unique identification and GraphViz attribute generation that can be extended
 * by derived classes.
 *
 * The BaseNode class is designed to work seamlessly with the Boost Graph
 * Library while providing additional functionality specific to GHL's needs. It
 * supports optional serialization capabilities when the GHL_SERIALIZATION flag
 * is defined.
