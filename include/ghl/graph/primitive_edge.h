/**
 * @file primitive_edge.h
 *
 * @brief Defines the base class for edge properties in the Generic Graph
 * Library.
 *
 * This file contains the PrimitiveEdge class which serves as the foundation for
 * all edge property classes in the GHL. It extends boost::no_property to
 * maintain compatibility with the Boost Graph Library while adding unique
 * identification capabilities for GHL's extended functionality.
 *
 * The PrimitiveEdge class parallels BaseNode in providing core property
 * management for graph elements, but specifically for edges rather than
 * vertices. It supports optional serialization when the GHL_SERIALIZATION flag
 * is defined.
