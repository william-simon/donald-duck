/**
 * @file cereal.h
 *
 * @brief Provides serialization utilities and macros for the GHL.
 *
 * This file sets up the serialization infrastructure for the Generic Graph
 * Library using the cereal serialization library. It defines a set of macros
 * that simplify the process of implementing serialization for different types
 * of graph components, including:
 * - Base class serialization
 * - Derived class serialization with polymorphic support
 * - Automatic registration of types with cereal
 *
 * The macros defined here are used throughout the GHL to provide consistent
 * serialization behavior across all serializable components.
